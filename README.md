How does it work?

This game is a modified version of Rock Paper Scissors, originally imagined by the writers of Big Bang Theory.

    The game is easy, here are the rules.



    Rock crushes Scissors and Lizard.
    Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.
    The Lizard eats the Paper and poisons Spock
    Spock smashes Scissors and vaporises Rock.
